# Tank Game

This is a simple 2D browser-based tank shooting game developed as part of a university course in Web Development. The game is implemented using HTML5 Canvas, JavaScript, and CSS.

## How It Works

    - The player controls a tank and aims to shoot down randomly placed targets.

    - The cannon angle and shooting power can be adjusted using keyboard controls.

    - The game incorporates basic physics, including gravity and wind effect, which influence the bullet's trajectory.

    - Players are given limited ammo and must aim strategically.

    - The difficulty increases as targets become smaller with a higher score.

Controls

    - W / S: Increase or decrease shot power

    - A / D: Rotate the cannon left or right

    - Space: Fire a bullet

    - P: (Debug/bonus) Add one ammo
